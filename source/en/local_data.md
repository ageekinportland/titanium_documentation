This guide will prepare you to work with local data sources in a Titanium mobile application.  By the end of
this guide, you should understand:

* The different modes of local storage and when to use each
* How to use application properties

# Working With Local data

Even the most rudimentary applications usually have some data storage requirements. As always, Titanium provides access to all the native functionality via its convenient, uniform interface. To use a device's local storage, the following objects are applicable:

* `Titanium.App.Properties` is ideal for storing application-related settings
* `Titanium.Database` provides access to the local SQLite3 database
* `Titanium.Filesystem` facilitates file and directory manipulation

Each of these enable data to persist on a device across application restarts, power cycles, reinstallation and even migration to a new device.

## What kind of data storage should I use?

The decision about which of the three local data options you choose is usually quite apparent.

1. **Properties**. Use these when one or all of the following is true:
    * the data a simple key/value pair
    * the data is related to the application rather than the user
    * the data does not require other data in order to be meaningful or useful
    * there only needs to be one version of the data stored at any one time
2. **Database**. Use this when one or all of the following is true:
    * there are many items of data
    * items of data relate to each other
    * you need strong control over how the data will be presented when you retrieve it
    * similar data accumulates over time, is transactional, or logging/archiving
3. **Filesystem**. Use this when one or all of the following is true:
    * the data is already provided in file format
    * the data is an image file

<note>
Although the local database has the capability to store images in blob (binary) format, this won't provide optimal performance to your application. Instead, use `Titanium.Database` to store the image file path and name in the database, and `Titanium.Filesystem` to manage the physical files.

To keep the local filesystem organised, and thus easier to manage and backup, it's good practice to keep similar files, like these images, in the same location. Properties would be a good candidate for storing this filesystem path, as it is an application setting.
</note>

# Application Properties

<info>
Both iOS and Android store properties in special files on the filesystem. Natively, iOS properties are known as `NSUserDefaults`, which are stored in `.plist` files in the application's library directory. Android stores them in standard xml text files at `/data/data/com.domainname.appname/shared_prefs/titanium.xml`.

An application's property data is loaded into memory as the application launches, and exists there until it closes. This allows very rapid access to it, but at the cost of the increased baseline memory used by the application.
</info>

## Reading and Writing Properties

`Titanium.App.Properties` has six sets of get/set methods for handling six different data types:

* **getBool() / setBool()**: a boolean value (true, false, 1, 0)
* **getDouble() / setDouble()**: a double-precision floating point number
* **getInt() / setInt()**: an integer
* **getList() / setList()**: an array
* **getString() / setString()**: a string

These *get* methods accept a property name and default value, while the *set* methods require the property name and property value pairs. This is demonstrated below:

<code class="javascript">
var window = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
    backgroundColor:'#999'
});
var myArray = [
	{name:'Name 1', address:'1 Main St'},
	{name:'Name 2', address:'2 Main St'},
	{name:'Name 3', address:'3 Main St'},
	{name:'Name 4', address:'4 Main St'}
];
Ti.App.Properties.setString('myString','This is a string');
Ti.App.Properties.setInt('myInt',10);
Ti.App.Properties.setBool('myBool',true);
Ti.App.Properties.setDouble('myDouble',10.6);
Ti.App.Properties.setList('myList',myArray);
Ti.API.info("String = " + Ti.App.Properties.getString('myString','This is a string default'));
Ti.API.info("Integer = " + Ti.App.Properties.getInt('myInt',20));
Ti.API.info("Boolean = " + Ti.App.Properties.getBool('myBool',false));
Ti.API.info("Double = " + Ti.App.Properties.getDouble('myDouble',20.6));
Ti.API.info("List = " + Ti.App.Properties.getList('myList'));
window.open();
</code>

This code results in the following output:

<pre>
String = This is a string
Integer = 10
Boolean = true
Double = 10.600000381469727
List =
  {  'address' :  '1 Main St' 'name' :  'Name 1', },
  {  'address' :  '2 Main St' 'name' :  'Name 2', },
  {  'address' :  '3 Main St' 'name' :  'Name 3', },
  {  'address' :  '4 Main St' 'name' :  'Name 4', }
</pre>

## Storing JS objects as JSON in properties

If you have a complex JS object, you can convert it to a string and store it using the [Titanium.App.Properties.setString()](http://developer.appcelerator.com/apidoc/mobile/latest/Titanium.App.Properties.setString-method.html) method.

<code class="javascript">
var window = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
    backgroundColor:'#999'
});
var weatherData =
{
	"reports" : [
    {
        "city": "Mountain View",
        "condition": "Cloudy",
        "icon": "http://www.google.com/ig/images/weather/cloudy.gif"
    },
    {
        "city": "Washington, DC",
        "condition": "Mostly Cloudy",
        "icon": "http://www.google.com/ig/images/weather/mostly_cloudy.gif"
    },
    {
        "city": "Brasilia",
        "condition": "Thunderstorm",
        "icon": "http://www.google.com/ig/images/weather/thunderstorm.gif"
    }
  ]
};
Ti.App.Properties.setString('myJSON', JSON.stringify(weatherData));
Ti.API.info("The myJSON property contains: " + Ti.App.Properties.getString('myJSON', 'myJSON was not found'));
window.open();
</code>

This will output the following to the log:

<pre>
The myJSON property contains: {"reports":[{"icon":"http:\/\/www.google.com\/ig\/images\/weather\/cloudy.gif","condition":"Cloudy","city":"Mountain View"},{"icon":"http:\/\/www.google.com\/ig\/images\/weather\/mostly_cloudy.gif","condition":"Mostly Cloudy","city":"Washington, DC"},{"icon":"http:\/\/www.google.com\/ig\/images\/weather\/thunderstorm.gif","condition":"Thunderstorm","city":"Brasilia"}]}
</pre>

This stored object can later be converted back to an object using `JSON.parse()`:

<code class="javascript">
var myObject = JSON.parse(Ti.App.Properties.getString('myJSON'));
</code>

# Filesystem Storage

Titanium makes it simple to perform basic filesystem [CRUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) operations.  Before we dive into an example let's review a few of the most commonly used properties and methods:

#### Objects

* [Titanium.Filesystem](http://developer.appcelerator.com/apidoc/mobile/latest/Titanium.Filesystem-module) is the top level Filesystem module used for reading and saving files and directories on the device.
* [Titanium.Filesystem.File](http://developer.appcelerator.com/apidoc/mobile/latest/Titanium.Filesystem.File-object.html) is the file object which supported common filesystem based operations such as create, read, write, delete, etc.

#### Properties

* Data storage locations:
    * **applicationDataDirectory**: A readonly constant that indicates where your application data directory is located.  Place applications-specific files in this directory.
    * **resourcesDirectory**: A readonly constant where your application resources are located
    * **tempDirectory**: A readonly constant that indicates where your application can place temporary files

#### Methods

* **getFile**: returns a fully formed file path as a Titanium.Filesystem.File object
* **deleteFile**: delete the file
* **exists**: returns true if the file or directory exists on the device
* **extension**: return the file extension
* **move**: move the file to another path
* **rename**: rename the file
* **nativePath**: returns the fully resolved native path
* **read**: return the contents of file as blob
* **write**: write the contents to file
* **writeable**: returns true if the file is writeable
* **spaceAvailable**: return boolean to indicate if the path has space available for storage

## Writing files

This is best explained with a basic example.  We'll start off by creating a dummy JavaScript object that we'd like to store:
<code class="javascript">
var dataToWrite = {"en_us":{"foo":"bar"}};
</code>

Next we create a new directory:
<code class="javascript">
//NOTE: remember to use applicationDataDirectory for writes
var newDir = Titanium.Filesystem.getFile(Titanium.Filesystem.applicationDataDirectory,'mydir');
newDir.createDirectory();
Ti.API.info('Path to newdir: ' + newDir.nativePath);
</code>

Lets add a new file within the newly created directory:
<code class="javascript">
var newFile = Titanium.Filesystem.getFile(newDir.nativePath,'newfile.json');
</code>

An empty file is nice and all, but it would be even better with some data.  Lets fill it with the JavaScript object we created earlier:
<code class="javascript">
//Stringify the JavaScript object we created earlier and write it out to the new file
newFile.write(JSON.stringify(dataToWrite));
</code>

<note>
Our **dataToWrite** object must be serialized before we can write it to a file. [Titanium.JSON](http://developer.appcelerator.com/apidoc/desktop/latest/Titanium.JSON) provides a module for serializing and deserializing [JSON](http://www.json.org/).
</note>

## Reading files

What if we wanted to update the value of dataToWrite.en_us.foo?  For this we:

1. Read the file
2. Deserialize the object stored within the file
3. Update the property in question
4. Serialize the object
5. Write back the serialized object

<code class="javascript">
var newFile = Titanium.Filesystem.getFile(newDir.nativePath,'newfile.json');
var resources = JSON.parse(newFile.read().text);

resources.en_us.foo = 'baz'; //bar becomes baz
newFile.write(JSON.stringify(resources));
</code>

## Removing files

Nobody likes a mess.  Lets cleanup after ourselves.  First we'll remove the file and then directory:

<code class="javascript">
//We already have references to the file and directory objects.
//We just need to call their cooresponding delete methods.
newFile.deleteFile();
newDir.deleteDirectory();
</code>
